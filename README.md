# Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes OWO skin mod
OWO mod for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. If you have questions or issues, ping me in the OWO Discord.

## Installation
1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install the latest version of MelonLoader on your game executable.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/KeepTalkingAndNobodyExplodes_OWO//releases/latest/download/KeepTalkingAndNobodyExplodes_OWO.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the root directory of your game (one DLL goes in UserLibs, one DLL and the OWO sensations go in Mods).
3. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game. You don't need to accept "enable mods" on startup if you don't want to. This is a code level mod and runs externally and undetected.

## Featured effects
## Featured effects
- Bomb explosion

You can adjust the OWO sensations of each effect yourself. In the "Mods" directory, you will find an "OWO" folder. It contains all the used sensations in this mod, and you can open, edit, and overwrite them using the OWO Sensation Creator.
